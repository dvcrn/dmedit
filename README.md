### Command line

## Building

MarkRight is written in clojurescript. To build, make sure you have clojure and leiningen installed on your system. 

### Requirements

- `npm`
- `leiningen`
- `bower`
- `npm install`
- `bower install`

### Compiling
All commands you need are available inside `package.json`. To compile the code, run `npm run compile:<prod/dev>`. `node/` is the folder that goes into electron.

### Development

To develop, run the self-reloading build:

- `lein run -m build/ui-dev`
- `lein run -m build/main-dev`

shadow-build will live-reload the frontend so you don't need to refresh. If you change `main.cljs` however, you'll have to restart electron to reload your changes.
